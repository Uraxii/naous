# Project-Corridor

# Mood Board

Watercolor manga style; pastel colors, thin outlines and detail crosshatching.

Think hand-drawn 3d style, similar to a npr (nonphotorealistic) TOON shader with outlines.

Think gradients, empty space without detail punctuated by dense fine details where it counts.

Think hand-drawn photoscanned textures or simple gradient textures plus an outline shader.
