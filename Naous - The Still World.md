# Naous - The Still World Lore

## The Fundamental Nature of the World

The world of Naous is not made of stone, soil, or physics in the traditional sense. It is built from thought—not imagination, but the raw cognitive substrate of the universe. This substance, called Naous, flows and folds like gravity, memory, and breath.

Where Naous bends tightly inward, it creates loops of recursive thought—and when those loops become stable, consciousness emerges. In this world, a person is not a soul in a body, but a localized knot of ideas, a bundle of tightly folded thought-patterns held together by conviction and feedback.

## Idea-Strands & the Formation of Identity

Each being is formed from Idea-Strands that loop into a stable shape. These strands are the building blocks of personality, memory, behavior, and even physical presence.

> “You are not in Naous. You are Naous, briefly self-aware.”

## Masks – Identity Made Solid

### What They Are

A Mask is a construct forged or slowly grown from Idea-Strands—beliefs and convictions that have stabilized into form. Psychologically, it serves as a defense: a structure built to interface with the world, to protect the vulnerable self, or to simplify overwhelming complexity.

But in Naous, that psychological structure is literal. A Mask hardens thought. It locks ideas into a stable identity, called a shade, that can be worn. When someone dons a Mask, they shape themselves according to its beliefs. The danger is not in wearing one—but in forgetting it is a mask at all.

### Why Beings Use Them

- To survive in a world where identity is fluid
- To preserve power, belief, or legacy
- To protect themselves from being lost or forgotten
- To define themselves clearly against social, cultural, or ideological pressures

### Consequences

Wearing a Mask grants clarity, stability, and power—but at a cost.

- **Diminishing Flexibility:** The longer a Mask is worn, the harder it becomes to think or feel outside the confines of that identity. Spontaneity fades. Curiosity withers. Thought begins to echo itself.
- **Draw to Stillness:** Each Mask extracts and ossifies a portion of Naous, reducing its flow. This “Draw” builds slowly but relentlessly.
- **Mask Acceleration:** Masks made from especially strong or singular ideas can amplify nearby Masks’ Draw, accelerating ossification in others. These powerful Masks are sometimes called *Anchors*.
- **Environmental Impact:** In areas where Draw accumulates, whole regions begin to calcify. Thought loops form geography. Memory crystallizes into terrain. These are known as **Stillness Zones**.
- **Loss of Self:** The Mask, once a tool, begins to control its wearer. The original self becomes a vessel for a single idea. Dreams, contradictions, and complexities are stripped away.
- **Stilling:** Eventually, the being becomes **Stilled**—a loop so tight it no longer flows. They are frozen in form and thought, unable to change, learn, or heal. The Stilled become mindless echoes of belief, trapped in repetitive, symbolic behavior.

> “A Mask grants strength by narrowing possibility. But what begins as choice becomes cage. And the cage forgets the one who built it.”

## The Stilled – Ossified Minds

A Stilled being is someone who has worn a Mask too long, or too rigidly. Their identity has hardened so completely that they become severed from the flow of Naous.

They are not dead—but they are no longer truly conscious. They exist in loops of behavior and thought, repeating themselves without growth or reflection. Their minds are lost to symbolic obsession. They haunt Stillness Zones like broken memories.

More powerful Stilled, whose Masks were forged from overwhelming or dominant ideologies, can subtly shape the environment and influence weaker Stilled in the area—amplifying loops, spawning guardians, or manifesting challenges reflective of their Mask’s belief. However, they do not lead or rule in any traditional sense. Their presence is more like a dominant psychic storm.

Stillness Zones resemble dungeons formed from the psyche—distorted realms built from recurring thought. Each zone is a looping landscape of metaphor, memory, and belief, created by the ossified mind that anchors it.

## Echoes – Fragments of Thought

When a being perishes, their ideas don’t fully disappear. Some fragments—especially those with strong emotional or cognitive weight—remain in the world as **Echoes**.

**Echoes are:**

- Memories or instincts made manifest
- Usable as abilities or passives by Bearers
- Still tied to the Draw of the ideas that created them

They represent the lingering truth of a being’s life and can be slotted by players to shape their playstyle. But they come with emotional weight—stronger Echoes create more Draw, bringing the Bearer closer to ossification.

---

## Draw – Emotional Load & Limitation

Every Mask has a **Draw capacity**—a limit on how much weight it can carry before risking ossification. Every Echo contributes to this Draw, depending on the strength and rigidity of the idea it contains.

**Players must balance:**

- Power (strong Echoes)
- Flexibility (weaker, more fluid Echoes)
- Draw management (avoiding being overwhelmed or Stilled)

---

## Bearers – You, the Player

Bearers are rare beings born—or awakened—when Naous begins to calcify too deeply. They are fluid identities, capable of resisting ossification and can easily switch Masks.

- Can wield and combine Echoes
- Can wear and swap Masks
- Can perform the **Rite of Unmasking**—a sacred act that defeats a Stilled being and returns their locked thought to Naous

They are not simply heroes—they are corrective mechanisms, born from Naous itself to restore flow to a system choking on its own permanence.

> “You are not a soul. You are the pressure release. The knot that did not tighten.”

---

## Unmasking the Stilled

The central act of gameplay and story progression.

- Defeating a Mask-bound Stilled being isn’t just combat—it is a ritual severance
- You remove their Mask, returning their locked thought-patterns back into the Naous
- This restores flow to the region, clears calcified zones, and releases new Echoes
- It is both an exorcism and a memorial

To unmask someone is to kill who they were—but to also let them change again.

## Cultural & Societal Themes

### Ossified Cultures

- View Masking and Stillness as sacred preservation
- Maintain power through immortal Masks passed through generations
- Construct cities, rituals, and laws around ideological stasis
- Consider Bearers to be heretical, dangerous, or even monstrous

> While Ossified cultures once thrived, their centers have often succumbed to Stillness. What remains are haunted ruins and echoing institutions, not functioning societies.

### Fluid Cultures

- Embrace Mask-switching, identity cycles, and change
- May burn Masks after major life events
- View ossification as spiritual failure
- Consider Bearers sacred, or even kin to gods

## The Nature of Naous (In-World Philosophy)

- Naous is not a god, but the cognitive substrate of reality
- Where it flows freely, thought is dynamic
- Where it is folded, minds are born
- Where it is looped too tightly, minds ossify
- Consciousness is an inevitable byproduct of Naous folding back on itself
- Masks are how beings carve pieces of Naous into personal structure
- Too many Masks cause the stream to calcify
- Bearers exist to restore the current

> “You are not your Mask. You are the current it dammed.”
